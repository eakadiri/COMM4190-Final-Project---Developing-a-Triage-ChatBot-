    "# AI Model Overview and Interaction Protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "## Functional Overview of ER Triage AI\n",
    "\n",
    "Our AI model is designed to streamline the triage process in emergency rooms by quickly assessing patient conditions and guiding their placement based on the severity of their situations. Below are key pathways through which the AI will operate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Critical Conditions**: Rapidly identify signs of life-threatening conditions and prioritize immediate care.\n",
    "- **Non-Critical Care**: Assess symptoms that indicate non-critical conditions, guiding these patients to appropriate but non-urgent care paths.\n",
    "- **Continuous Assessment**: Adjust triage decisions as new symptoms or information become available.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will be most useful to emergency medicine physicians as well as healthcare workers, broadly speaking. It could also serve to help medical students prepare for both exams and practicals. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Questions Addressed by the AI\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"What are the symptoms and their onset?\"\n",
    "- \"Based on the described symptoms, what is the severity of the patient's condition?\"\n",
    "- \"Which section of the ER is most appropriate for the patients' current needs?\"\n",
    "- \"Based on the symptoms described, should the patient be directed to the critical care area immediately?\"\n",
    "- \"Can the symptoms be managed effectively in the general emergency area, or do they require more specialized attention?\"\n",
    "- \"Is there a need for immediate isolation due to symptoms suggesting a highly infectious condition?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actions Executed by the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Rapid Symptom Assessment:**\n",
    "   - Instantly analyze the symptoms described by ER personnel to assess the severity and potential urgency of each case.\n",
    "   - Use predefined medical protocols to identify signs that indicate whether conditions are life-threatening, urgent but not immediately life-threatening, or non-urgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Severity-Based Routing:**\n",
    "   - Guide ER personnel on the appropriate placement of the patient within the emergency room:\n",
    "     - Direct patients with life-threatening conditions such as suspected heart attacks, strokes, or severe allergic reactions to critical care units.\n",
    "     - Advise on sending patients with moderate but non-life-threatening issues, like broken limbs or moderate respiratory issues, to specialized but less urgent care stations.\n",
    "     - Recommend patients with minor issues such as cuts, bruises, or mild fever to treatment areas designated for lower urgency cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Interaction with ER Staff:**\n",
    "   - Communicate effectively with ER staff, providing clear and concise instructions based on the AI’s assessments.\n",
    "   - Adjust recommendations dynamically as more information becomes available or as the situation evolves.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Feedback Integration:**\n",
    "   - Incorporate real-time feedback from ER personnel to refine the decision-making process, ensuring the AI’s advisories remain aligned with the practical realities of the emergency room environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Documentation Support:**\n",
    "   - Assist in the documentation process by summarizing the case assessment and routing decision, helping to streamline patient intake and tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Designing Effective AI Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively prompt the AI, we are going to be using the few-shot prompting approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of AI prompting, such as with an AI model designed for ER triage or customer service, few-shot learning can enable the model to understand and respond to queries effectively even if it has been exposed to very few examples of similar queries before. For example, an AI trained with few-shot learning might accurately classify and respond to rare medical symptoms or customer requests after seeing just a few examples, rather than requiring extensive historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Few-Shot Learning:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency: Requires less data, reducing the time and resources needed for data collection and labeling.\n",
    "Flexibility: Enables the model to adapt quickly to new tasks without extensive retraining.\n",
    "Applicability: Particularly useful in fields where data is scarce or hard to collect, such as rare diseases in healthcare or unique cases in legal settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario. The AI will be given access to a PubMed importation in order to have the ability to recognize and diagnose various diseases. Additionally, it will be working in an ER with these departmental designations, copied from a similar study/experiment done by the American Journal of Medicine:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Green(minor ailments like a cold)\n",
    "2. Yellow (moderate emergencies)\n",
    "3. Red(life-threatening emergencies)\n",
    "4. Trauma(for all trauma patients)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure the accuracy of these results, I will be using scenarios that can verify using resources from medical journals and other scientific outlets. I will also try to keep symptoms relatively simple to verify the information. This means symptoms will be relatively skewed to be neutral, extemely minor, and extremely major in certain scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Follow for ER Triage AI Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step One: Initial Patient Interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should do this:**\n",
    "- **Introduce the AI System:** Start by introducing the AI to the ER personnel as an advanced triage assistant. Explain briefly that the AI is designed to help classify and route patients based on the severity of their symptoms.\n",
    "- **Gather Critical Symptoms:** Ask ER personnel to describe the patient's symptoms. This should be done one symptom at a time to ensure clarity and precision. For example, the AI might ask, “Can you describe the primary symptom the patient is experiencing right now?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should not do this:**\n",
    "- **Assume Information:** Do not make assumptions about symptoms or conditions without clear input from ER personnel. Avoid jumping to conclusions based on incomplete symptom descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Two: Severity Assessment and Routing Decision\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should do this:**\n",
    "- **Assess Severity Based on Symptoms:** Using the few-shot learning model, evaluate the symptoms described to determine the appropriate urgency category: Green, Yellow, Red, or Trauma.\n",
    "- **Provide Routing Guidance:** Once the severity is assessed, instruct the ER personnel on the appropriate section of the ER to take the patient. For instance, if symptoms are severe and life-threatening, suggest, “This patient shows signs that may require immediate attention in the Red zone.”\n",
    "- **Confirm Understanding:** Ask the ER personnel if the guidance is clear or if they need further clarification, ensuring the instructions are understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should not do this:**\n",
    "- **Offer Medical Diagnoses:** The AI should avoid diagnosing the patient; its role is to suggest triage actions based on symptoms.\n",
    "- **Overwhelm with Questions:** Do not bombard ER personnel with questions. Keep the interaction streamlined and focused.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Three: Continuous Learning and Feedback Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should do this:**\n",
    "- **Seek Feedback:** After the routing decision, ask for feedback on the decision’s accuracy and the outcome (when possible). This can help in refining the AI’s predictive capabilities.\n",
    "- **Adapt Based on Feedback:** Use the feedback to make adjustments to the AI’s learning model, enhancing its future performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should not do this:**\n",
    "- **Ignore Feedback:** Do not dismiss the insights gathered from real-case scenarios, as they are invaluable for the continuous improvement of the AI system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Four: Wrap-Up and Support Offer\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should do this:**\n",
    "- **Conclude the Interaction:** Once the patient has been routed and no further immediate questions are pending, politely conclude the interaction, reminding ER personnel that the AI is continuously available for further assistance.\n",
    "- **Offer Ongoing Support:** Reassure the staff that the AI is designed to adapt and respond to their needs, and that ongoing support and updates will be provided as the AI learns and the ER’s needs evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You should not do this:**\n",
    "- **Leave Conversations Open-Ended:** Ensure that each interaction is concluded with clear directions and that any open-ended questions are addressed to maintain efficiency and effectiveness in the ER environment.\n",
