### Introduction
***

Throughout the semeseter, we have looked at various LLM's, their usages, and how to effectively prompt and use them effeciently. For my final project, I decided to create a TriageBot that would have the capaicty to direct patients to where they need to go in an ER. 

### Propositional Value
***

In a typical ER, it’s common to see up to 230 patients in a given day. Doctors, nurses, and other hospital staff are given the difficult task of assigning patients to departments, then to doctors, and finally, working as a team to come up with a proper prognosis. When patients arrive at the ER, they are sent to the triage room where their injuries are assessed and sent to the appropriate area (Paslı et al. 2024). The typical system in the U.S. is the START (simple triage and rapid treatment) triage system which is designed to be calculated in less than 60 seconds. A number of factors are taken into account, including the patient’s pulse, breathing rate, capillary refill time, level of bleeding, and composure under

Due to this high demand in the emergency departments of many hospitals, there is an increasing need for artificial intelligence tools that would minimize the amount of time patients spend in the ER. The inclusion of AI would have the potential to increase the speed and resource allocation in the ER due to its ability to store immense amounts of data as well produce consistent results. Easy to train tools like ChatGPT-4 are able to be trained on large amounts of data and can quickly analyze patient symptoms, vital signs, and health status based on shared data (Paslı et al. 2024). By training a chat based model on the rules of the emergency department, it is possible that it could work just as efficiently as an experienced triage team.
